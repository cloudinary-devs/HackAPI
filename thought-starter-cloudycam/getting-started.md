# Creating and Testing a React App

## Create a React app

**Note:** If you manage dependencies on your machine with Yarn, download the package runner `npx`. However, if you use NPM for dependency management, you can skip that step because `npx` is already bundled with NPM \(version 5.2 or higher\).

To add `npx` to Yarn, run this command on your terminal:

```text
    yarn global add npx
```

Afterwards, create a starter React project, which you will tweak as you proceed with this tutorial:

```text
    npx create-react-app cloudy-cam-pwa
```

## Test the Sample React App

To ensure that the project is in place, go to the app's directory and start the development server:

```text
    cd cloudy-cam-pwa
    yarn start # or npm start
```

The above command starts a development server on `http://localhost:3000`. Navigating to that URL on your browser displays the React app:
